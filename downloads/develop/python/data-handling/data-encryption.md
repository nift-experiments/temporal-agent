> Encrypt data sent to and from the Temporal Service using a custom Payload Codec in the Python SDK.

Payload Codecs transform `Payload` bytes after serialization (by the Payload Converter) and before the data is sent to the Temporal Service.
Unlike Payload Converters, codecs run outside the Workflow sandbox, so they can use non-deterministic operations and call external services.

The most common use case is encryption: encrypting payloads before they reach the Temporal Service so that sensitive data is never stored in plaintext.

## PayloadCodec interface

Implement a `PayloadCodec` with `encode()` and `decode()` methods.
These should loop through all of a Workflow's payloads, perform your marshaling, compression, or encryption steps in order, and set an `"encoding"` metadata field.

In this example, the `encode` method compresses a payload using Python's [cramjam](https://github.com/milesgranger/cramjam) library to provide `snappy` compression.
The `decode()` function implements the `encode()` logic in reverse:

```python
import cramjam
from temporalio.api.common.v1 import Payload
from temporalio.converter import PayloadCodec

class CompressionCodec(PayloadCodec):
    async def encode(self, payloads: Iterable[Payload]) -> List[Payload]:
        return [
            Payload(
                metadata={
                    "encoding": b"binary/snappy",
                },
                data=(bytes(cramjam.snappy.compress(p.SerializeToString()))),
            )
            for p in payloads
        ]

    async def decode(self, payloads: Iterable[Payload]) -> List[Payload]:
        ret: List[Payload] = []
        for p in payloads:
            if p.metadata.get("encoding", b"").decode() != "binary/snappy":
                ret.append(p)
                continue
            ret.append(Payload.FromString(bytes(cramjam.snappy.decompress(p.data))))
        return ret
```

## Configure the codec on the Data Converter

Add a `data_converter` parameter to your `Client.connect()` options that overrides the default converter with your Payload Codec:

```python
from codec import CompressionCodec

client = await Client.connect(
    "localhost:7233",
    data_converter=dataclasses.replace(
        temporalio.converter.default(), payload_codec=CompressionCodec()
    ),
)
```

For reference, see the [Encryption](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/tree/main/encryption) sample.

## Codec Server

A Codec Server is an HTTP server that runs your `PayloadCodec` remotely, so that the Temporal Web UI and CLI can decode encrypted payloads for display.

For more information, see [Codec Server](/codec-server).
