# Quickstart

Configure your local development environment to get started developing with Temporal.

## Install the Java JDK

Make sure you have the Java JDK installed. You can either download a copy directly from Oracle or select an OpenJDK
distribution from your preferred vendor.

You'll also need either Maven or Gradle installed.

**If you don't have Maven:** [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and
[install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) from Apache.org, or use Homebrew: `brew install maven`.

**If you don't have Gradle:** [Download](https://gradle.org/install/) from Gradle.org, use
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (bundled), or use Homebrew: `brew install gradle`.

```bash
java -version
```

## Create a Project

Now that you have your build tool installed, create a project to manage your dependencies and build your Temporal
application.

Choose your build tool to create the appropriate project structure. For Maven, this creates a standard project with the
necessary directories and a basic pom.xml file. For Gradle, this creates a project with build.gradle and the standard
Gradle directory structure.

**Maven**

```bash
mkdir temporal-java-project
```

```bash
cd temporal-java-project
```

```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=helloworkflow -DartifactId=temporal-hello-world
-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

```bash
cd temporal-hello-world
```

**Gradle**

```bash
mkdir temporal-hello-world
```

```bash
cd temporal-hello-world
```

```bash
gradle init --type java-application --project-name temporal-hello-world --package helloworkflow
```

## Add Temporal Java SDK Dependencies

Now add the Temporal SDK dependencies to your project configuration file.

For Maven, add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml` file. For Gradle, add the following lines to your
`build.gradle` file.

Next, you'll configure a local Temporal Service for development.

**Maven**

```xml
<dependencies>
  <!--
    Temporal dependencies needed to compile, build,
    test, and run Temporal's Java SDK
  -->

  <!--
    SDK
  -->

<dependency>
  <groupId>io.temporal</groupId>
  <artifactId>temporal-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>1.33.0</version>
</dependency>

  <dependency>
    <!--
      Testing
    -->
    <groupId>io.temporal</groupId>
    <artifactId>temporal-testing</artifactId>
    <version>1.33.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**Gradle**

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'application'
}

repositories { mavenCentral() }

dependencies {
    implementation 'io.temporal:temporal-sdk:1.33.0'
    testImplementation 'io.temporal:temporal-testing:1.33.0'
}

// Define the main class for the application
application { mainClass = 'helloworkflow.Starter' }

// Helper tasks to run the worker and the starter
tasks.register('runWorker', JavaExec) {
    group = 'application'
    description = 'Run the Temporal worker'
    classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
    mainClass = 'helloworkflow.SayHelloWorker'
}

tasks.register('runStarter', JavaExec) {
    group = 'application'
    description = 'Run the workflow starter'
    classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
    mainClass = 'helloworkflow.Starter'
}
```

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Install Temporal CLI and start the development server

The fastest way to get a development version of the Temporal Service running on your local machine is to use
[Temporal CLI](/cli).

Choose your operating system to install Temporal CLI:

**macOS**

Install the Temporal CLI using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install temporal
```

**Windows**

Download the Temporal CLI archive for your architecture:

- [Windows amd64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=windows&arch=amd64)
- [Windows arm64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=windows&arch=arm64)

Extract it and add `temporal.exe` to your PATH.

**Linux**

Download the Temporal CLI for your architecture:

- [Linux amd64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=linux&arch=amd64)
- [Linux arm64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=linux&arch=arm64)

Extract the archive and move the `temporal` binary into your PATH, for example:
```bash
sudo mv temporal /usr/local/bin
```

## Start the development server

Once you've installed Temporal CLI and added it to your PATH, open a new Terminal window and run the following command.

This command starts a local Temporal Service. It starts the Web UI, creates the default Namespace, and uses an in-memory
database.

The Temporal Service will be available on localhost:7233. The Temporal Web UI will be available at
http://localhost:8233.

Leave the local Temporal Service running as you work through tutorials and other projects. You can stop the Temporal
Service at any time by pressing CTRL+C.

Once you have everything installed, you're ready to build apps with Temporal on your local machine.

After installing, open a new Terminal. Keep this running in the background:
```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

#### Change the Web UI port
The Temporal Web UI may be on a different port in some examples or tutorials. To change the port for the Web UI, use the `--ui-port` option when starting the server:
```bash
temporal server start-dev --ui-port 8080
```

The Temporal Web UI will now be available at http://localhost:8080.

## Run Hello World: Test your installation

Now let's verify your setup is working by creating and running a complete Temporal application with both a Workflow and
Activity.

This test will confirm that:

- The Temporal Java SDK is properly installed
- Your local Temporal Service is running
- You can successfully create and execute Workflows and Activities
- The communication between components is functioning correctly

### 1. Create the Activity Interface

Create an Activity interface file (GreetActivities.java):

_Note that all files for this quickstart will be created under src/main/java/helloworkflow._

```java
package helloworkflow;

import io.temporal.activity.ActivityInterface;
import io.temporal.activity.ActivityMethod;

@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetActivities {

    @ActivityMethod
    String greet(String name);

}
```

An Activity is a method that executes a single, well-defined action (either short or long running), which often involve
interacting with the outside world, such as sending emails, making network requests, writing to a database, or calling
an API, which are prone to failure. If an Activity fails, Temporal automatically retries it based on your configuration.

You define Activities in Java as an annotated interface, and its implementation.

### 2. Create the Activity Implementation

Create an Activity implementation file (GreetActivitiesImpl.java):

```java
package helloworkflow;

public class GreetActivitiesImpl implements GreetActivities {

    @Override
    public String greet(String name) {
      return "Hello " + name;
    }

}
```

### 3. Create the Workflow

Create a Workflow file (SayHelloWorkflow.java):

```java
package helloworkflow;

import io.temporal.workflow.WorkflowInterface;
import io.temporal.workflow.WorkflowMethod;

@WorkflowInterface
public interface SayHelloWorkflow {

    @WorkflowMethod
    String sayHello(String name);

}
```

Workflows orchestrate Activities and contain the application logic. Temporal Workflows are resilient. They can run and
keep running for years, even if the underlying infrastructure fails. If the application itself crashes, Temporal will
automatically recreate its pre-failure state so it can continue right where it left off.

You define Workflows in Java as an annotated interface, and its implementation.

### 4. Create the Workflow Implementation

Create a Workflow implementation file (SayHelloWorkflowImpl.java):

```java
package helloworkflow;

import io.temporal.activity.ActivityOptions;
import io.temporal.workflow.Workflow;

import java.time.Duration;

public class SayHelloWorkflowImpl implements SayHelloWorkflow {

    private final GreetActivities activities = Workflow.newActivityStub(
      GreetActivities.class,
      ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
        .build()
    );

    @Override
    public String sayHello(String name) {
      return activities.greet(name);
    }

}
```

### 5. Create and Run the Worker

Create a Worker file (SayHelloWorker.java):

```java
package helloworkflow;

import io.temporal.client.WorkflowClient;
import io.temporal.serviceclient.WorkflowServiceStubs;
import io.temporal.worker.Worker;
import io.temporal.worker.WorkerFactory;

public class SayHelloWorker {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

      WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
      WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
      WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);

      Worker worker = factory.newWorker("my-task-queue");
      worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(SayHelloWorkflowImpl.class);
      worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new GreetActivitiesImpl());

      System.out.println("Starting SayHelloWorker for task queue 'my-task-queue'...");

      factory.start();

    }

}
```

With your Activity and Workflow defined, you need a Worker to execute them.

Open a new terminal and run the Worker:

**Maven**

```bash
cd temporal-hello-world
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="helloworkflow.SayHelloWorker"
```

**Gradle**

```bash
./gradlew runWorker
```

A Worker polls a Task Queue, that you configure it to poll, looking for work to do. Once the Worker dequeues a Workflow
or Activity task from the Task Queue, it then executes that task.

Workers are a crucial part of your Temporal application as they're what actually execute the tasks defined in your
Workflows and Activities. For more information on Workers, see
[Understanding Temporal](/evaluate/understanding-temporal#workers) and a [deep dive into Workers](/workers).

### 6. Execute the Workflow

Now that your Worker is running, it's time to start a Workflow Execution.

This final step will validate that everything is working correctly with your file labeled `Starter.java`.

Create a separate file called `Starter.java`:

```java
package helloworkflow;

import io.temporal.client.WorkflowClient;
import io.temporal.client.WorkflowOptions;
import io.temporal.serviceclient.WorkflowServiceStubs;

public class Starter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
        WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);

        SayHelloWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(
            SayHelloWorkflow.class,
            WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                .setTaskQueue("my-task-queue")
                .setWorkflowId("say-hello-workflow-id")
                .build()
        );

        String result = workflow.sayHello("Temporal");
        System.out.println("Workflow result: " + result);

        service.shutdown();
        service.awaitTermination(10, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    }
}
```

While your worker is still running, open a new terminal and run:

**Maven**

```bash
cd temporal-hello-world
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="helloworkflow.Starter"
```

**Gradle**

```bash
./gradlew runStarter
```
