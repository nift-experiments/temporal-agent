> Optimize Workflow Execution with Temporal Ruby SDK - Set Workflow Timeouts and Retry Policies efficiently.

## Workflow timeouts 

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-execution-timeout)**: Limits how long the full Workflow Execution can run.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-run-timeout)**: Limits the duration of an individual run of a Workflow Execution.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-task-timeout)**: Limits the time allowed for a Worker to process a Workflow Task.

Set these values as keyword parameter options when starting a Workflow.

```ruby
result = my_client.execute_workflow(
  MyWorkflow, 'some-input',
  id: 'my-workflow-id', task_queue: 'my-task-queue',
  execution_timeout: 5 * 60
)
```

## Workflow retries 

A Retry Policy can work in cooperation with the timeouts to provide fine controls to optimize the execution experience.

Use a [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) to automatically retry Workflow Executions on failure.

Workflow Executions do not retry by default, and Retry Policies should be used with Workflow Executions only in certain situations.

The `retry_policy` can be set when calling `start_workflow` or `execute_workflow`.

```ruby
result = my_client.execute_workflow(
  MyWorkflow, 'some-input',
  id: 'my-workflow-id', task_queue: 'my-task-queue',
  retry_policy: Temporalio::RetryPolicy.new(max_interval: 10)
)
```
