# Quickstart

This guide walks you through setting up the Temporal Ruby SDK and running your first Workflow. In just a few steps,
you'll install the SDK and start a local development server. To validate that your local environment is correctly
installed, we will execute a Workflow that will output "Hello, Temporal".

## Installation

This step sets up a new Ruby project using Bundler and installs the Temporal Ruby SDK.

We recommend using [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) to manage your Ruby project dependencies, including the Temporal SDK.
These tutorials assume Ruby 3.4.3 or higher.

Follow the steps to create a directory, initialize the project with a `Gemfile`, and add the Temporal SDK.

**Note:**

- Only macOS ARM/x64 and Linux ARM/x64 are supported.
- Source gem is published but **cannot be built directly**.
- Windows (MinGW) is not supported.
- `fibers`/`async` are only supported on Ruby **3.3+**.
- See [Platform Support](#) for full details.

**1. Check your Ruby version:**
```bash
ruby -v
```

You should see output like `ruby 3.4.3`. Ruby 3.2+ is required. We recommend Ruby 3.4.3.

**2. Create your project folder:**
```bash
mkdir temporal-project
cd temporal-project
```

**3. Initialize with Bundler:**
```bash
bundle init
```

**4. Add the Temporal Ruby SDK:**
```bash
bundle add temporalio
```

You should see output like:
```bash
Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/...
Resolving dependencies...
Installing temporalio 0.4.0 (arm64-darwin)
Bundle complete! 1 Gemfile dependency, 6 gems now installed.
```

**5. Install dependencies:**
```bash
bundle install
```

## Install Temporal CLI

The fastest way to get a development version of the Temporal Service running on your local machine is to use
[Temporal CLI](/cli).

Choose your operating system to install Temporal CLI.

**macOS**

Install the Temporal CLI using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install temporal
```

**Windows**

Download the Temporal CLI archive for your architecture:

- [Windows amd64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=windows&arch=amd64)
- [Windows arm64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=windows&arch=arm64)

Extract it and add `temporal.exe` to your PATH.

**Linux**

Download the Temporal CLI for your architecture:

- [Linux amd64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=linux&arch=amd64)
- [Linux arm64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=linux&arch=arm64)

Extract the archive and move the `temporal` binary into your PATH, for example:
```bash
sudo mv temporal /usr/local/bin
```

## Start the development server

Once you've installed Temporal CLI and added it to your PATH, open a new Terminal window and run the following command.

This command starts a local Temporal Service. It starts the Web UI, creates the default Namespace, and uses an in-memory
database.

The Temporal Service will be available on localhost:7233. The Temporal Web UI will be available at
http://localhost:8233.

Leave the local Temporal Service running as you work through tutorials and other projects. You can stop the Temporal
Service at any time by pressing CTRL+C.

Once you have everything installed, you're ready to build apps with Temporal on your local machine.

After installing, open a new Terminal window and start the development server:

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

#### Change the Web UI port
The Temporal Web UI may be on a different port in some examples or tutorials. To change the port for the Web UI, use the `--ui-port` option when starting the server:
```bash
temporal server start-dev --ui-port 8080
```

The Temporal Web UI will now be available at http://localhost:8080.

## Run Hello World: Test your installation

Now let's verify your setup is working by creating and running a complete Temporal application with both a Workflow and
Activity.

This test will confirm that:

- The Temporal Ruby SDK is properly installed
- Your local Temporal Service is running
- You can successfully create and execute Workflows and Activities
- The communication between components is functioning correctly

### 1. Create the Activity

Create an Activity file (say_hello_activity.rb):

```ruby
require 'temporalio/activity'

# Implementation of a simple activity
class SayHelloActivity < Temporalio::Activity::Definition
  def execute(name)
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  end
end
```

### 2. Create the Workflow

Create a Workflow file (say_hello_workflow.rb):

```ruby
require 'temporalio/workflow'
require_relative 'say_hello_activity'

class SayHelloWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
  def execute(name)
    Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
      SayHelloActivity,
      name,
      schedule_to_close_timeout: 300
    )
  end
end
```

### 3. Create and Run the Worker

With your Activity and Workflow defined, you need a Worker to execute them. Workers are a crucial part of your Temporal
application as they're what actually execute the tasks defined in your Workflows and Activities. For more information on
Workers, see [Understanding Temporal](/evaluate/understanding-temporal#workers) and a
[deep dive into Workers](/workers).

Create a Worker file (worker.rb):

```ruby
require 'temporalio/client'
require 'temporalio/worker'
require_relative 'say_hello_activity'
require_relative 'say_hello_workflow'

# Create a client
client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'default')

# Create a worker with the client, activities, and workflows
worker = Temporalio::Worker.new(
  client:,
  task_queue: 'my-task-queue',
  workflows: [SayHelloWorkflow],
  # There are various forms an activity can take, see "Activities" section for details
  activities: [SayHelloActivity]
)

# Run the worker until SIGINT. This can be done in many ways, see "Workers" section for details.
worker.run(shutdown_signals: ['SIGINT'])
```

Run the Worker:

```bash
ruby worker.rb
```

### 4. Execute the Workflow

Now that your Worker is running, it's time to start a Workflow Execution.

Create a separate file called starter.rb:

```ruby
require 'temporalio/client'
require_relative 'say_hello_workflow'

# Create a client
client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'default')

# Run workflow
result = client.execute_workflow(
  SayHelloWorkflow,
  'Temporal', # This is the input to the workflow
  id: 'my-workflow-id',
  task_queue: 'my-task-queue'
)
puts "Result: #{result}"
```

Then run:

```bash
ruby starter.rb
```

### Verify success

If everything is working correctly, you should see:

- Worker processing the workflow and activity
- Output: `Workflow result: Hello, Temporal!`
- Workflow Execution details in the [Temporal Web UI](http://localhost:8233)
